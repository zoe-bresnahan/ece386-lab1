Serving handwritten digit inference with FastAPI.

See [USAFA ECE 386: AI Hardware Applications - Lab 1](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece386-book/b1-prediction/lab-digits-api.html)

**GitHub Actions are enabled in this repository!** The workflow currently:

- Runs [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) format checker against client and server
- Runs [Pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/) type checker against client and server

## Writeup

*Answer the following questions. Strive to be articulate.*

### What strategies did you use to ensure that your client and server where communicating with the same schema?

### In regard to preprocessing your digit images, how well do you think your server would scale to *any* picture of a digit?

### Does the client/server architecture make sense for this problem? Why or why not?

## Documentation

*Documentation statement. Pay special attention to the LLM policy.*
